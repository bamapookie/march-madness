# Milestone 0.6.0 Plan — Bracket Viewer & Leaderboard

## Prerequisites confirmed

- `resolved_brackets` and `entry_scores` tables are already in the schema.
- `recomputeAllScores(seasonId)` stub already exists in `src/lib/scoring.ts` and is already called by
  `src/lib/import.ts` after every successful import.
- `resolveInitialBracket` and `applyActualResults` are fully implemented in `src/lib/bracket.ts`.
- `scoreEntry` is fully implemented in `src/lib/scoring.ts`.
- **A migration is required** for three new fields added in this milestone (see Schema Changes below).

---

## Schema Changes (migration required)

### `BracketSlot` — add `isInProgress`

```prisma
isInProgress Boolean @default(false)
```

Set to `true` during each import run when the ESPN event for this slot has `status.type.state === "in"`. Cleared back to
`false` when the final result is recorded for this slot. Allows the bracket viewer to show a distinct "Game in progress"
chip without an extra API call at view time.

### `EntryScore` — add `breakdownJson` and `maxPotentialRemaining`

```prisma
breakdownJson        Json? // ScoreBreakdownJson shape; null until first score computation
maxPotentialRemaining Int?  // null until first score computation; -1 signals "not computable"
```

Both fields are nullable and backwards-compatible — existing rows keep `null` until the next `recomputeAllScores` run.

---

## Step 1 — Implement `recomputeAllScores` in `src/lib/scoring.ts`

Replace the no-op stub with a real implementation. This is the heart of the milestone.

**Algorithm:**

1. Load all active competitions for the season (with their `settingsJson`).
2. For each competition, load all `CompetitionEntry` rows (with their `rankingList` → `rankingEntries` → `school`).
3. Skip any entry whose ranking list's effective lock time has not yet passed (not yet locked — entries may still
   change).
4. Load all `TournamentResult` rows for the season; convert to `ActualResultItem[]`.
5. Load all `BracketSlot` rows for the season (both genders).
6. For each entry: a. Build `rankMap: RankMap` from the entry's `rankingEntries`. b. If a `ResolvedBracket` row does not
   yet exist for this entry, call `resolveInitialBracket(...)` and upsert it. Once written, the original bracket never
   changes. c. If `reseed_mode = "reseed_by_ranking"`, call
   `applyActualResults(originalBracket, actualResults, "reseed_by_ranking", rankMap)` to get the current reseeded
   bracket. Otherwise use the original bracket. d. Call `scoreEntry(...)` with the (possibly reseeded) bracket, actual
   results, and competition settings. e. Serialize `scoreEntry`'s `breakdown` result into `breakdownJson` (see Step 2
   for shape). f. Compute `maxPotentialRemaining` (see Step 1a below). g. Upsert the `EntryScore` row with `mensScore`,
   `womensScore`, `totalScore`, `tiebreaker`, `breakdownJson`, and `maxPotentialRemaining`.
7. Log progress/errors; do not throw — failures for individual entries should not abort the whole run.

**File:** `src/lib/scoring.ts` (replace stub in place; no new file needed).

**Lock time helper:** The ranking list's effective lock time is
`settings.lock_mode === "BEFORE_FIRST_FOUR" ? season.firstFourLockAt : season.roundOf64LockAt`.

**`resolveInitialBracket` input shape** (from `src/types/index.ts`):

```ts
BracketResolutionInput = {
  gender: Gender;
  slots: BracketSlotInput[]; // field is `slots`, not `bracketSlots`
  rankMap: RankMap;
}
```

Call it once for `MENS` and once for `WOMENS`; store both JSON blobs in `mensJson` / `womensJson`.

### Step 1a — Computing `maxPotentialRemaining`

The goal is: given the current state of the real tournament, what is the maximum number of additional points this entry
could still earn if all of their remaining predictions come true?

**For `reseed_mode = "fixed"`:**

Build a set of eliminated schools from `actualResults` (all `losingSchoolId` values). Then for each unplayed game slot
(no `TournamentResult` for that `bracketSlotId`), look up the predicted winner from the original bracket and check if
that school is eliminated. If not eliminated, the user could still earn:

- **Correct winner**: `correct_winner_points[round]` if `"correct_winner"` is in `scoring_mode`.
- **Round advancement**: `round_points[round]` if `"round_advancement"` is in `scoring_mode` AND this round is strictly
  before the team's predicted exit round (i.e. a round where they were predicted to win).
- **Seeding accuracy bonus**: if `seeding_bonus_enabled` AND this is the team's predicted exit game (the round they were
  predicted to _lose_ in), add `seeding_bonus_points[predictedExitRound]`. This bonus is only counted once per team —
  for the specific game slot where they were predicted to exit.

Sum across all unplayed game slots for both genders. Exclude `first_four` if `lock_mode = "before_round_of_64"`.

**For `reseed_mode = "reseed_by_ranking"`:**

Apply the three-case classification defined in Decision Point 5. For each unplayed game slot in the current reseeded
bracket:

- **Case A (both teams reseeded)**: add `correct_winner_points[round]` only.
- **Case B (both teams original)**: same calculation as the fixed bracket above — CW + RA + seeding bonus at predicted
  exit.
- **Case C (one original, one reseeded)**: add CW (if original team is predicted winner), RA (if round < original team's
  predicted exit round), and seeding bonus (if this is the original team's predicted exit slot and they have not yet
  advanced past it). Future slots on the original team's path through the bracket are processed in the same iteration
  and accumulate their contributions as Case A, B, or C in turn.

Seeding bonus guard for Case B and C: if an original team has already advanced past their originally-predicted exit
round in real tournament results, their seeding bonus is forfeit — do not count it for any remaining slots.

---

## Step 2 — New types in `src/types/index.ts`

Add the following types:

```ts
// The shape stored in EntryScore.breakdownJson.
// Captures earned points by scoring method and gender so the UI can show a full
// breakdown of where every point came from.
export type ScoreBreakdownJson = {
  mens: {
    roundAdvancement: number; // points from round_advancement scoring mode
    correctWinner: number; // points from correct_winner scoring mode
    seedingBonus: number; // points from seeding accuracy bonus
    total: number;
  };
  womens: {
    roundAdvancement: number;
    correctWinner: number;
    seedingBonus: number;
    total: number;
  };
  total: number;
};

// Leaderboard row returned by GET /api/competitions/[id]/leaderboard
export type LeaderboardEntry = {
  rank: number;
  entryId: string;
  userId: string;
  userName: string | null;
  userAvatar: string | null;
  rankingListName: string;
  mensScore: number;
  womensScore: number;
  totalScore: number;
  tiebreaker: number; // abs(mens - womens); lower is better
  maxPotentialRemaining: number | null; // null = not yet computed (no scoring run has occurred yet)
  computedAt: string | null; // ISO timestamp; null = not yet computed
};

// Response shape for GET /api/competitions/[id]/leaderboard
export type LeaderboardResponse = {
  entries: LeaderboardEntry[];
  isLocked: boolean; // true if competition is past its effective lock time
  lastComputedAt: string | null; // most recent computedAt across all entry scores
};

// Score breakdown detail for one entry
export type EntryScoreDetail = {
  entryId: string;
  rankingListId: string;
  rankingListName: string;
  mensScore: number;
  womensScore: number;
  totalScore: number;
  tiebreaker: number;
  maxPotentialRemaining: number | null; // null = not yet computed (no scoring run has occurred yet)
  breakdown: ScoreBreakdownJson | null; // null until first computation
  computedAt: string | null;
};

// Response shape for GET /api/competitions/[id]/entries/[entryId] (GET added in Step 3)
export type EntryDetailResponse = {
  entry: CompetitionEntrySummary;
  score: EntryScoreDetail | null;
  resolvedBracket: ResolvedBracketData | null; // null if not yet computed
  actualResults: ActualResultItem[];
  inProgressSlotIds: string[]; // bracket slot IDs for games currently in progress
};
```

---

## Step 3 — New and updated API routes

### 3a. `GET /api/competitions/[id]/leaderboard/route.ts` _(new file)_

- Auth required; same `canViewCompetition` access check as the lobby (`src/lib/competition.ts`).
- Query `EntryScore` for all entries in this competition, join with `CompetitionEntry` → `User` + `RankingList`.
- Sort: `totalScore DESC`, then `tiebreaker ASC` (lower tiebreaker wins), then `submittedAt ASC` (stable order).
- Assign `rank` (handle ties: entries with equal score and tiebreaker share the same rank number).
- Return `{ data: LeaderboardResponse, error: null }`.
- If no scores exist yet (tournament not started / entries not locked), return an empty `entries: []` array with
  `isLocked: false`.

### 3b. `GET /api/competitions/[id]/entries/[entryId]/route.ts` _(add GET to existing file)_

The file currently only has `DELETE`. Add `GET`:

- Auth required; must be the entry owner, the competition organizer, or any competition member who has ≥1 submitted
  entry (post-cutoff access rules).
- Load `CompetitionEntry` with `resolvedBracket`, `score`, and `rankingList` → `rankingEntries` → `school`.
- Load `TournamentResult` rows for the season as `ActualResultItem[]`.
- Query `BracketSlot` where `isInProgress = true` for the season; extract their IDs as `inProgressSlotIds`.
- Return `{ data: EntryDetailResponse, error: null }`.
- If `resolvedBracket` is null (not yet computed), return it as null — the UI will show a placeholder.

### 3c. `GET /api/ranking-lists/[id]/bracket/route.ts` _(new file)_

Standalone bracket viewer for a user's own ranking list (outside any competition context).

- Auth required; must own the ranking list.
- Resolve the bracket live from `rankingEntries` + `bracketSlots` (call `resolveInitialBracket`).
- Load actual results for the season.
- Query `BracketSlot` where `isInProgress = true` for the season; extract their IDs as `inProgressSlotIds`.
- Return
  `{ data: { resolvedBracket: ResolvedBracketData, actualResults: ActualResultItem[], inProgressSlotIds: string[] }, error: null }`.

---

## Step 4 — `BracketViewer` component (`src/components/bracket/bracket-viewer.tsx`)

A `"use client"` React component.

**Props:**

```ts
{
  resolvedBracket: ResolvedBracketData;   // mens + womens resolved games
  actualResults: ActualResultItem[];
  inProgressSlotIds: string[];            // slot IDs for games currently being played
  schoolNames: Record<string, string>;    // schoolId → display name
  showScore?: boolean;                    // show correct/wrong overlays
}
```

**Layout:**

- Toggle tabs at top: **Men's** / **Women's**.
- Within each tab:
  - 4 region cards arranged in a 2×2 grid (e.g. East, West top row; South, Midwest bottom row).
  - Each region card shows rounds as columns: R64 → R32 → S16 → E8 (left to right).
  - Each game slot shows: School A name vs. School B name, with predicted winner highlighted.
  - Overlay chip per slot when `showScore` is true — four mutually exclusive states determined in this priority order:
    1. 🔄 **In progress** — slot ID is in `inProgressSlotIds` (game is currently being played; no winner yet).
    2. ✅ **Correct** — game is complete and predicted winner matches `actualResults`.
    3. ❌ **Wrong** — game is complete and predicted winner does not match `actualResults`.
    4. ⬜ **Not yet played** — no result and not in progress.
  - The "in progress" state takes priority over everything since a result may have just arrived or may be stale.
  - Below the 4 regions: a **Final Four / Championship** section showing the 2 semis + championship game.

**No SVG bracket lines required for this milestone.** The focus is getting all information into the bracket view
clearly. Visual polish (connecting lines, bracket art) is deferred to 0.7.0.

**Import responsibility:** During each import run, `src/lib/import.ts` must set `isInProgress = true` on any
`BracketSlot` whose ESPN event has `status.type.state === "in"`, and set `isInProgress = false` on slots that are now
complete (result recorded) or not yet started. This flag is the sole source of truth for the "in progress" chip.

**Fallback:** If `resolvedBracket` is null, show a "Bracket not yet available" message.

---

## Step 5 — Leaderboard page (`src/app/competition/[id]/leaderboard/page.tsx`)

Server component.

- Apply the same `canViewCompetition` gate used in the lobby page.
- Fetch leaderboard data server-side via direct DB query (same logic as the API route — or call the shared lib function
  if extracted).
- Render a ranked table:

  | #   | User          | Entry                            | Men's | Women's | Total | Max Remaining | Tiebreaker |
  | --- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------------- | ---------- |
  | 1   | Avatar + Name | Entry name (link → entry detail) | 120   | 115     | 235   | 40            | 5          |

- **Max Remaining** column: show the `maxPotentialRemaining` value. If `null`, show "—" (scoring has not yet run).
- Tiebreaker column: show the value with a tooltip "Lower = better balanced across Men's & Women's".
- Guard: if no `TournamentResult` rows exist for the season, redirect to the competition lobby — the lobby will show the
  "first game" message in place of the leaderboard link.
- "Back to Competition" link at top.
- Accessible from the competition lobby via a "Leaderboard →" button that is only rendered once a result exists; until
  then a static message reads _"The leaderboard will be available once the first game begins."_

---

## Step 6 — Entry detail page (`src/app/competition/[id]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx`)

Server component.

- Auth + access check (entry owner, organizer, or member w/ entry).
- Render two panels side by side (or stacked on mobile):
  - **Score panel**: total score, Men's score, Women's score, tiebreaker value, max potential remaining (shown as "—" if
    not yet computed), `computedAt` timestamp. If score is null, show "Scores not yet computed."
    - Include a **score breakdown table** driven by `breakdownJson`:

      | Scoring Method    | Men's | Women's | Total |
      | ----------------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
      | Correct Winner    | 80    | 75      | 155   |
      | Round Advancement | 30    | 30      | 60    |
      | Seeding Bonus     | 10    | 10      | 20    |
      | **Total**         | 120   | 115     | 235   |

    - Only show rows for scoring methods that are active in the competition settings.

  - **Bracket panel**: `<BracketViewer>` component with `showScore={true}` and actual results overlaid. If
    `resolvedBracket` is null, show "Bracket not yet available — check back after the competition locks."

- "Back to Leaderboard" link.

---

## Step 7 — Standalone bracket viewer (`src/app/bracket/[id]/page.tsx`)

Server component. `[id]` = ranking list ID.

- Auth required; must own the ranking list.
- Resolve bracket live (or read from any `ResolvedBracket` associated with the list's competition entries).
- Render `<BracketViewer>` without score overlay (this is just a preview of their picks).
- Link back to the ranking editor (`/ranking/[id]`).

Note: the existing `src/app/bracket/page.tsx` is a placeholder — replace or redirect it to the user's dashboard if they
have ranking lists, or show a "You don't have any ranking lists yet" state.

---

## Step 8 — Navigation & lobby wiring

### Nav (`src/components/nav.tsx`)

No new top-level nav link needed — bracket and leaderboard are always reached from within a competition or ranking list.

### Competition lobby (`src/app/competition/[id]/page.tsx`)

- If at least one `TournamentResult` exists for the season: show a **"Leaderboard →"** button/link.
- Otherwise: show the static message _"The leaderboard will be available once the first game begins."_ in the same
  location. The message is the same whether the competition is pre-lock or locked — users don't need the distinction.
- Update the entries table (in `lobby-client.tsx`) so each entry row is a clickable link to
  `/competition/[id]/entries/[entryId]` when the competition is locked and a score exists.

### Ranking list card (`src/components/ranking/ranking-list-card.tsx`)

- Add a "View Bracket →" link to `/bracket/[id]`.

---

## Decision points to resolve before implementation

1. **Reseeded bracket caching** ✅ _resolved_: `recomputeAllScores` recomputes the reseeded bracket on every run. For
   competitions with many entries and `reseed_by_ranking`, this is fine since scoring runs only on import (not on every
   read). No schema change needed — the current approach is sufficient.

2. **Leaderboard visibility before the first game** ✅ _resolved_: The leaderboard link and page are hidden until at
   least one `TournamentResult` row exists for the season (i.e. the first game of the tournament is in progress or
   complete). The threshold is the first game for the season overall — not per-competition — because the tournament
   schedule is the same for everyone. Wherever a "Leaderboard →" button or link would appear (competition lobby, entry
   detail page), show a static message in its place instead:
   - If the competition has **not yet locked**: _"The leaderboard will be available once the first game begins."_
   - If the competition **is locked but no results exist yet**: _"The leaderboard will be available once the first game
     begins."_
   - The message is the same in both cases — users don't need to know the internal reason, only when to come back. The
     leaderboard page itself (`/competition/[id]/leaderboard`) should also guard against direct URL access and redirect
     to the competition lobby with the same message if no results exist yet.

3. **Bracket viewer visual fidelity** ✅ _resolved_: Deferred to 0.7.0. For this milestone, the priority is getting all
   necessary information — matchup names, predicted winner, chip status — clearly visible in a functional layout.
   Connecting lines and NCAA-style bracket art are a 0.7.0 polish task.

4. **Score breakdown storage** ✅ _resolved_: Add `breakdownJson Json?` to `EntryScore` (nullable,
   backwards-compatible). The shape (`ScoreBreakdownJson`) captures points by gender and by scoring method
   (roundAdvancement, correctWinner, seedingBonus). Populated during `recomputeAllScores`; avoids re-running
   `scoreEntry` on every page view. A migration is required (see Schema Changes above).

5. **Max potential remaining under `reseed_by_ranking`** ✅ _resolved_: Classify each unplayed game slot in the reseeded
   bracket into one of three cases based on how many of the two competing teams are **original predicted teams** (teams
   that appear in that slot in the original bracket and are still alive in the real tournament vs. having been replaced
   by a reseeded substitute).

   **Case A — Both teams are reseeded** (both original predicted teams for this slot were eliminated):
   - Only **CW points** apply: `correct_winner_points[round]` if the predicted winner of the slot wins.
   - RA and seeding bonus are both tied to the original bracket's predictions. Since neither original team is present in
     this slot, neither can be earned here.

   **Case B — Both teams are original predicted teams** (both still in their originally-predicted positions):
   - Same calculation as the fixed bracket (see Step 1a). All three categories apply: CW for the predicted winner, RA
     for the predicted winner (if round < their predicted exit round), and seeding bonus for the predicted loser (if
     this is their predicted exit game). Both contributions (winner and loser) are counted simultaneously since it is
     the same game outcome.

   **Case C — Mixed: one original predicted team, one reseeded team**:
   - A single-slot calculation is insufficient. The correct approach is to trace the original team's remaining path
     forward from this slot through all future unplayed game slots they are predicted to appear in, up to and including
     the game where they were originally predicted to lose (or through the championship game if they were predicted to
     win it all). For each slot in this path:
     - **CW**: add `correct_winner_points[round]` if the original team is the predicted winner of that slot in the
       reseeded bracket (i.e. their rank position is lower than their opponent's).
     - **RA**: add `round_points[round]` if `"round_advancement"` is in `scoring_mode` AND the round is strictly before
       the original team's predicted exit round (rounds they were originally predicted to win).
     - **Seeding bonus**: add `seeding_bonus_points[predictedExitRound]` if `seeding_bonus_enabled` AND this is the
       original team's predicted exit game AND the team has not yet advanced past that round in the real tournament (if
       they have already advanced past their predicted exit, the seeding bonus is forfeit and should not be counted for
       any remaining slots).
   - **Implementation note**: when iterating over all unplayed slots to compute total max potential, Case C does not
     require a separate lookahead pass. Future slots on the original team's path will naturally be visited during the
     same iteration; each will be classified again as Case A, B, or C, and their contributions will accumulate
     correctly. The "trace forward" framing simply means: do not stop attributing potential points to an original team
     when you first encounter a mixed slot — continue processing all their future unplayed slots as well.

   **Sentinel removal**: `maxPotentialRemaining = -1` is no longer needed. Reseeded brackets are now computable using
   the three-case algorithm above. The schema field remains `Int?` (nullable); `null` means not yet computed (no scoring
   run has occurred), and a non-null value always represents the computed max potential.

---

## Implementation order

```
0. Migration          — add isInProgress to BracketSlot; breakdownJson + maxPotentialRemaining to EntryScore
1. src/lib/scoring.ts — implement recomputeAllScores (+ Step 1a max potential)
2. src/lib/import.ts  — update isInProgress flag on BracketSlot during each import run
3. src/types/index.ts — add ScoreBreakdownJson, updated LeaderboardEntry, EntryScoreDetail, EntryDetailResponse
4. API routes         — leaderboard GET, entry GET, standalone bracket GET
5. src/components/bracket/ — BracketViewer component
6. Leaderboard page   — src/app/competition/[id]/leaderboard/page.tsx
7. Entry detail page  — src/app/competition/[id]/entries/[entryId]/page.tsx
8. Standalone bracket viewer — src/app/bracket/[id]/page.tsx
9. Nav & lobby wiring — lobby + ranking list card links
```

The migration (step 0) and import update (step 2) are prerequisites for steps 1 and 5 respectively. Steps 3–4 are pure
logic/API with no UI dependency; steps 5–8 depend on step 4 and on each other only loosely. Step 9 is the final wiring
pass.
